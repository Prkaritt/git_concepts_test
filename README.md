#HELLO WORLD
This is the file that I have created to learn the concepts of GIT
And currently I am trying to push more than one files on my repository.
The commands are :
git --version (To check the version of my git and whether git is installed in my pc)
git status (To know the status of the files whether they are tracked or untracked) 
            For tracked files, git keeps the track of all the changes that have been made in the file
            For untracked files, git does not keep the track of any changes that have been made. For these kind of files, git just knows that a new file has been created
git add file_name : This command is used to enable tracking in the file such that git can keep 
                    the   track of the changes in the file 
git add --all : This command is used to enable tracking on all the files in the current folder in 
                the local storage.
